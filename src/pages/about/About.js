      <p>
        Sticking to good habits and reaching your goals is hard. MoneyHabits gives you a way to monetize your goals and habits
        by attaching a dollar value to them. Whenever you complete a habit or a goal and log it, its value will be added to your total
        balance. Whenever you spend money on a luxury (eating out, clothes, etc), you subtract cash from this balance.
      </p>
      <h2 className='py-4 text-center'>Why does this work?</h2>
      <p>
        Habits help you reach long-term goals, but the goal can often feel far away. MoneyHabits attaches a real value to your habits,
        which enables you to feel the impact of what you are doing. This system connects rewards and habits, which gives you incentive 
        to prioritize habits, keep track of spending, and quantify your progress.

      <h2 className='py-4 text-center'>How do I start?</h2>
      <p>Sign up for an account to start logging habits and save your progress! It's helpful to get into the routine of
        logging your habits at the end of the day to make sure you log every day.
